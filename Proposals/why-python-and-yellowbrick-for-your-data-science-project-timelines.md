# Why Python and yellowbrick for data science project

# Outline:
## Why Python?
- data from Kaggle and KDnugget


## Why yellowbrick
- what is yellowbrick?--video maybe that could be inserted into the quick start guide.  I can envision that.
- what can it do?--yeah this is good.  maybe this a case study or a series of small case studies/problems to try.
- why/how is it different from other visualization packages--
*my understanding of this is the ML component.
*Other packages display the data/image which is important but YB takes to a ML function and displays those results and that's what makes it powerful.  
*we could talk about matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh, pandas visualization function itself.  
*I think the format here could be maybe a blog post with screenshots of like 1 problem/dataset displayed in the various packages.
- why is it better than other visualization packages--Is a better question when and why should you use it?  I need to think about this a little more.
